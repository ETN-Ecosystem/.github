# ETN Ecosystem 🌐

Welcome to the official **ETN Ecosystem** GitHub repository! The ETN Ecosystem is a blockchain-powered initiative that provides diverse utilities built on the **TON Blockchain**. This project leverages **ET Netsa Coin ($ETN)** to enable seamless access to decentralized services, education, governance, and Web3 technologies in a user-centric way.

## 🌟 Overview  
The ETN Ecosystem is designed to bridge blockchain technology with real-world applications and foster innovation within emerging economies. Our mission is to empower individuals and businesses by integrating **decentralized solutions**, creating opportunities for **education**, **commerce**, and **governance**.

The ecosystem provides multiple components, including but not limited to:

1. **ETN Coin**: The native utility token used across all services in the ecosystem.
2. **ETN DNS**: A decentralized domain naming system allowing users to purchase and manage blockchain domains.
3. **ETN Hosting**: Web hosting services integrated with the TON blockchain, including reverse proxy services.
4. **ETN Learn**: An online learning platform providing blockchain and Web3 education, with payments accepted only in $ETN.
5. **ETN Pay**: A payment gateway enabling seamless transactions using $ETN.
6. **Governance DAO & NFTs**: Tokenized governance, including **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** and governance NFTs, ensuring transparent community-driven decision-making.
